# How to Create a Support Ticket

To create a new support ticket, you have two options:

1.  **Private Ticket**: Click the "Create Ticket" button in the #support channel. This will create a private thread between you and the support bot.

2.  **Public Forum**: Post your question directly in the #public-support forum channel. The bot will reply there, and everyone can see the conversation.

# Escalating to a Human

If the bot cannot answer your question, or if you explicitly ask to "speak to a human", your ticket will be automatically escalated to the human support team. A member of the team will join your thread to assist you further.
